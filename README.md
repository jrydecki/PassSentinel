# PassSentinel

PassSentinel is a local password manager for Windows. It [securely stores*](#disclaimer) your usernames and 
passwords for various sites and accounts.

## Overview

PassSentinel is an application that stores usernames, passwords, and notes locally on your computer.
By using a password manager like PassSentinel, you don't have to worry about remembering your passwords for
all your sites, just your one master password! It also contains an password generator so that you can have
random and more secure passwords for all your accounts and sites.

My purpose is for PassSentinel to [securely store this sensitive information*](#disclaimer) locally so you always have
access to your passwords. My intention was this to work as sort of a backup of other big-name password managers.
This local password manager is a hobby-project of mine.


## Installation

1. Download the **installer** latest release [here](https://github.com/jrydecki/PassSentinel/releases). (Not the source code!)
2. Extract the files from the downloaded ZIP file.
3. Run the `setup.exe` file.


## DISCLAIMER

PassSentinel has not had the rigorous review by ***any*** security experts required for a production-level use
or trust of securely storing your passwords. I do not in any way guarantee or assert that this application is certainly secure.
***Use at your own risk and discretion.***

With that being said, *I* believe it is secure -- such that I myself use this application to store all my personal passwords.
I believe that if the database file is obtained or exposed, the passwords would still be infeasible to obtain (assuming your password
is unknown, of course).
